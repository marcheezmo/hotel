# Hotel Project

## Description

This site is built with the basic's of HTML and CSS. For now this project is nonresponsive and not mobile friendly.

## What I learned:

- HTML syntax
- ID's, Classes and how to use them
- CSS syntax and how that changes what's being viewed
- Utilized Font Awesome for the icons
- HTML and CSS are the basics of a webpage. Created separately and put together, they make up a webpage.

## Addition to original project:
- Features page

### In the works project:
- Add mobile responsive
